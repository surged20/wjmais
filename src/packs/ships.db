Along with the Tradesman, it is one of the common ships used for hauling, trading, and traveling. It is a solid choice for transporting small groups between celestial bodies or moving a bit of cargo from area to area with minimal crew.</p><p>Another interesting use has been as a traveling home. The Dragonfly has just enough room to permit the entire cargo storage to be changed into a workshop. Many craftsman use this as an opportunity to stock up on a few months of food, sail out into a quiet part of space, and work for months in slight isolation.</p><h3>Example Weapons</h3> <ul><li>@Compendium[wjmais.items.Light Catapult], 1x rear</li></ul><h2>Model Variations</h2> <p>The Dragonfly comes in a variety of designs, each which take advantage of its small size, speed, and agility.</p><h3>Smuggler</h3> <p>So long as there are people and factions that oppose certain types of trade, there will be smugglers. This variant of the Dragonfly has its armor class reduced to 11, but gains the Flee the Scene feature.</p><p><strong>Flee the Scene.</strong> This ship's movement speed increases by 500ft. if it is moving away from another ship that is within 3,000ft. of it.</p><h3>Wizard's Ship</h3> <p>This variant is designed to maximize cargo space, usually for those who want a mobile workshop or home. This variant of the Dragonfly loses its small hardpoint and has its armor class reduced to 10, but its cargo hold increases to 8 tons.</p><h3>Firefly</h3> <p>This variant of the Dragonfly is stripped of all valuables, packed with explosives, sometimes given a Fire Projector, and a cheap mechanical Helm similar to those used by fighters. A Fighter Helmsman will fly this variant in, light things on fire, and then collide this ship against the target before ejecting. This variant loses all bulwark points, has a crew (min/max) of 1/1, has a special hardpoint for mounting a Fire Projector, and gains the Volatile Design feature.</p><p><strong>Volatile Design.</strong> When this ship drops to 0 hull points, it immediately explodes. Any ship within 500ft. Of this ship when it explodes takes 14 ([[/r 4d6]]) mega fire damage.</p><h3>Heavy Dragonfly</h3> <p>Every so often, someone will have a Dragonfly designed with more armor in mind. This variant has its AC increased to 14 but its speed reduced to 3,500ft (135°) This variant is not common, as most looking for an armored craft would aim for a wildjammer like a Wasp or Threshership instead.</p><h3>Fighterfly</h3> <p>The standard combat variant of the Dragonfly is the Fighterfly.

The main variation of the Cuttle Command is to act as a command ship through the use of its Helm Network. This allows the Helmsman of the Cuttle Command to watch the movements of all linked wildjammers and coordinate a strategic plan between all of them in real time. This makes the Cuttle Command a powerful ship in managing fleet tactics.</p><h3>Wizard's Ship</h3> <p>Much like the Dragonfly variation of the same name, this variation sees the Cuttle Command transformed from command ship into a mobile laboratory, workshop, or shrine.  With considerably more room than the Dragonfly (and considerably higher cost), this option is really only there for those with large sums of wealth and a desire for privacy. The 3 large hardpoints not mounted to a tentacle are removed in exchange for increasing its cargo storage to 62 tons.</p><h3>Fiery Victory</h3> <p>This variation is named after the famed wildjammer, the <i>Ultimate Victory</i> that was regrettably destroyed in a mutiny.  This variation's speed is increased to 2,000ft (45°) and the four tentacle mounted hardpoints are changed to small size and affixed with four @Compendium[wjmais.items.Fire Projector]{fire projectors}.</p><h3>Mobile Base</h3> <p>This variation was designed to be a forward base for explorers or colonies from already established settlements. The 3 large hardpoints not mounted to tentacles are removed and replaced with 4 more tons of cargo storage and 2 new space docks for ships to dock at between exploratory missions.

The remaining 24 are split half down each side of the main deck for broadside attacks. Regrettably, much like the Galleon, the Clipper wasn't originally designed for use in space. As a result, both ships lack the elegance in design necessary for smooth sailing in space, reflected by low maneuverability.</p><p>That said, you can't put 26 cannons on a ship without the giff being interested There are plenty of wildjammers out there, but the Clipper has a lot more gunpowder than others of its class.

Alternatively, the Clipper can be used as a command ship for a giff admiral Usually when this is done, it is accompanied by 3 to 6 additional clippers as supporting heavy warships.</p><p>There is only one configuration that greatly deviates and it is generally created by groundlings, called the Merchantman.  Those who are native to wildspace will generally avoid using the Clipper at all and favor other cargo ships and the giff are highly unlikely to change the Clipper away from cannons.</p><h3>Merchantman</h3> <p>Groundling civilizations don't only build Clippers as warships, but sometimes as cargo transport or mercantile ships. This variation removes the forward and aft medium hardpoint and every other hardpoint along the main deck is slimmed to a medium hardpoint.

This massive wildjammer was designed to carry significantly more forces than the standard Nautiloid model, including potentially housing an elder brain pool for long voyages.

Its AC is increased to 21 and its hardpoints are replaced by 12 large hardpoints. As a consequence of these changes, the cargo hull is reduced to 8 tons and its speed is reduced to 2,000ft (0°). The fact that this variation is so heavy it can't realistically maneuver in combat has lead to it being of limited use. The perceived value is in using supporting Nautiloids to drive enemy wildjammers into range of the heavily armed Dreadnought.</p><h3>Colony Ship</h3> <p>Every so often, the illithids seek a way to spread themselves to a new world. This often means they need to move an elder brain from one world to another. Since elder brains maintain much of the knowledge of their species, guarding these is of the utmost importance. The Dreadnought's AC is increased to 22 and its cargo hold is reduced to 18 tons. Of these 18 tons, 3 are set aside exclusively for the elder brain.</p><p>To attack a colony ship is viewed by illithids as the greatest of crimes.

This variant is exceptionally difficult to find if one isn't given one by the Elven Imperial Navy. This variant gains the following feature:</p><p><strong>Starfly Hull.</strong> This ship can be healed by the @Compendium[wjmais.spells.Repair Hull] spell multiple times per day.</p><h3>Thick Wood Hull</h3> <p>This is the wooden variant crafted by shipwrights not associated with the Elven Imperial Navy. This variant is more commonly found, but its speed is reduced to 2,500ft (90°)</p><h3>Fighter Carrier</h3> <p>This variation was originally designed by the Elven Imperial Navy, but other shipwrights have also begun to mimic its design. When grown by elves, this variation is the same as the starfly, but its speed is reduced to 2,500ft (45°) and it loses 3 of its medium hardpoints. In exchange, its cargo hold is increased to 50 tons. When created by other shipwrights, this variation is the same as the thick wood hull, except its speed is reduced to 2,500ft (45°), it loses 3 of its medium hardpoints, and its AC is reduced to 15.</p><p>In exchange for these reductions, the cargo hold on both types is increased to 50 tons. This allows the Man-o-War to carry up to 10 fighter bays for deploying fighter craft, whether they be Spirit Warriors or Blades. The Elven Imperial Navy almost exclusively use this variation for carrying large numbers of elven Bladesingers prepared to use their swordsmanship skills in a Spirit Warrior.</p><h3>Mobile Saloon</h3> <p>This variation is usually created by independent elves or dwarves that are looking to make it into a saloon. This variation usually starts as the thick wood hull, and then has its speed reduced to 2,500ft (45°) and its AC reduced to 15 in exchange for its cargo hold increasing to 42 tons.  This storage space is used for stockpiling anything that travelers might pay a premium for. Most of the time, this is alcohol or drugs. After months of travel, most sailors are more than willing to pay the considerably higher prices of the mobile saloon owners. Mobile saloons also tend to carry food, water, star charts, and just about any standard commodity a wildjammer in space might need, so long as they are willing to pay more than market value for it.</p>","public":""},"source":"WJMAiS pg. 60"},"traits":{"size":"lg","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dimensions":""},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"vehicleType":"sea","cargo":{"crew":[],"passengers":[]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"kKrrDlkpfIaOdPk6":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Man-o-War","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":2,"height":2,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"Bulwark Points"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"light":{"dim":0,"bright":0,"angle":360,"alpha":0.25,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"color":null,"coloration":1,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"texture":{"src":"modules/wjmais/assets/man-o-war-token.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":0,"brightness":1,"color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"visionMode":"basic"}},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

These enormous undead insects would house an elven warrior inside of their chest cavity and amplify the skill of the warrior. This allowed for elven warriors to bring their considerable skill with a sword into ship vs ship combat.</p><p>Acquiring a spirit warrior wasn't easy. A promising warrior would be granted a small egg, no larger than the size of a pinhead, that had undergone a secret ritual. The warrior would incubate the egg, protecting it and warming it with their own body. After half a year, the egg would hatch into a larva. The warrior would raise the larva and form a strong emotional bond. They would feed it, play with it, think happy thoughts that the larva can feel. This lasts until the larva is a year old, at which point it has matured. Once the larva has matured, it continues to live with the warrior until it dies of old age.</p><p>As soon as it dies, the magic cast upon it as an egg activates. The carcass expands to an enormous size and its chest cavity grows a space for its bonded warrior. When its bonded warrior enters the chest cavity for the first time, the two of them become as one. The warrior's skill becomes the spirit warrior's skill, and the spirit warrior's body becomes the warrior's body.</p><p>True spirit warriors are hard to find and impossible to buy. If a spirit warrior's bonded warrior is dead or abandoned it, another creature can occupy it and try to bond, but that is rare. The easiest way to get a hold of a Spun warrior is to buy an arcanomechanical one off the market. These don't bonding with the warrior in the same way as a true spirit warrior, but they do just fine as a fighter-craft.</p><h3>Helm</h3> <p>The spirit warrior doesn't carry a Wildjammer Helm. Instead, it either flies naturally or mechanically. This generates propulsion through residual magic in wildspace. It can't fly at jamming speeds and the Fighter Helmsman doesn't need to be a spellcaster.</p><h3>Example Weapons</h3> <ul><li><em>Longsword (Mega Scale)</em></li></ul><h2>Model Variations</h2> <p>The spirit warrior comes in a variety of types The stat block presented here is a baseline stat block.

With a single large hardpoint, reasonable speed and maneuverability and a thick hull, it has become a favorite for pirates and adventurers, It also has a small open area on the top where the large hardpoint is situated that makes for an excellent spot to start a boarding attempt.</p><p>Another interesting feature of the Wasp is that it was designed to be able to be flooded The lizardfolk who designed the wildjammer wanted a way to submerge themselves in water while sailing through space. Having this much water in a wildjammer also allowed the lizardfolk that designed the Wasp to bring their pets along with them.</p><h3>Example Weapons</h3> <ul><li>@Compendium[wjmais.items.24-Pounder Long Gun], 1x front</li></ul><h2>Model Variations</h2> <p>Although the Wasp was originally designed for lizardfolk, its considerable strengths have resulted in it being a more widely adopted wildjammer.</p><h3>Pirate Ship</h3> <p>This variant of the Wasp is designed specifically to be able to land aboard other large wildjammers and board with ease.  This variant loses its ability to land in water but in exchange gains the Quick Boarding feature.</p><p><strong>Quick Boarding.</strong> When the Captain of this wildjammer uses their action for the Boarding Party bridge crew action, other creatures only need a bonus action to join and board the other wildjammer. If the Captain has the Expert Captain feature, the Captain can activate the Boarding Party bridge crew action as a bonus action and each other creature can join without using any action.</p><h3>Bee Class</h3> <p>This variant of the Wasp is designed for those who only intend to sail through space and want a more heavily armed combat wildjammer. This variant loses its ability to land anywhere but a space dock and has its cargo hold reduced to 3 tons, but in exchange it gains 2 additional large hardpoints. These additional hardpoints are almost always equipped with heavy ballistae because of the small crew size of the Wasp.  While 8 crew are required to make it function, that leaves just 10 crew for 3 large hardpoints.</p><h3>Bumble Bee</h3> <p>The bumble bee variant of the Wasp loses its large hardpoint and can only dock at space docks in exchange for 6 additional tons of cargo storage. This variant looks far more bloated than the standard Wasp, marking it as a merchant ship. Often bee class Wasps will find a way to disguse themselves as bumble bee variants to lure in unsuspecting pirates.</p><h3>Quickling</h3> <p>The quickling variant of the Wasp has its hull stripped in favor of quick maneuverability. This variant has its AC reduced to 14 and cargo hold storage reduced to 7 tons, but in exchange has its speed increased to 3,000ft (135?) and gains a medium hardpoint on the wildjammer's tail.</p>","public":""},"source":"WJMAiS pg. 49"},"traits":{"size":"sm","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dimensions":""},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"vehicleType":"sea","cargo":{"crew":[],"passengers":[]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"kKrrDlkpfIaOdPk6":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Wasp","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"Bulwark Points"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"light":{"dim":0,"bright":0,"angle":360,"alpha":0.25,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"color":null,"coloration":1,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"texture":{"src":"modules/wjmais/assets/wasp-token.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":0,"brightness":1,"color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"visionMode":"basic"}},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

The goal in creating the Threshership was to build an affordable and formidable combat ship for new privateers, who so often found themselves retrofitting commercial ships for combat purposes.</p><p>The Threshership has three hardpoints, two aimed out of its eye slots and one sitting on the top deck just above the head. The head itself acts as a ram, intending to charge up to enemy wildjammers or mega creatures and hit them in close range. This has lead to many using the Threshership as a Fire Projector platform, moving in close, hitting hard, and covering ships in waves of fire.</p><p>What adds to the versatility of the Threshership beyond just a combat wildjammer is that the wildjammer's fins act as landing gear for ground landings. This is beneficial since the cargo storage doors on the side of the wildjammer are partially submerged when in water, making unloading a real chore and the risk of taking on water not negligible.</p><h3>Example Weapons</h3> <ul><li>@Compendium[wjmais.items.Carronade], 1x front</li><li>2x @Compendium[wjmais.items.Medium Ballista]</li></ul><h2>Model Variations</h2> <p>While Thresherships do carry the artistic styling of whatever shipwright worked on creating it, there are no major variations to speak of.

The Dragonfly has just enough room to permit the entire cargo storage to be changed into a workshop.

A Fighter Helmsman will fly this variant in, light things on fire, and then collide this ship against the target before ejecting. This variant loses all bulwark points, has a crew (min/max) of 1/1, has a special hardpoint for mounting a Fire Projector, and gains the Volatile Design feature.</p><p><strong>Volatile Design.</strong> When this ship drops to 0 hull points, it immediately explodes.

The main variation of the Cuttle Command is to act as a command ship through the use of its Helm Network. This allows the Helmsman of the Cuttle Command to watch the movements of all linked wildjammers and coordinate a strategic plan between all of them in real time. This makes the Cuttle Command a powerful ship in managing fleet tactics.</p><h3>Wizard's Ship</h3> <p>Much like the Dragonfly variation of the same name, this variation sees the Cuttle Command transformed from command ship into a mobile laboratory, workshop, or shrine.  With considerably more room than the Dragonfly (and considerably higher cost), this option is really only there for those with large sums of wealth and a desire for privacy. The 3 large hardpoints not mounted to a tentacle are removed in exchange for increasing its cargo storage to 62 tons.</p><h3>Fiery Victory</h3> <p>This variation is named after the famed wildjammer, the <i>Ultimate Victory</i> that was regrettably destroyed in a mutiny.  This variation's speed is increased to 2,000ft (45°) and the four tentacle mounted hardpoints are changed to small size and affixed with four @Compendium[wjmais.items.Fire Projector]{fire projectors}.</p><h3>Mobile Base</h3> <p>This variation was designed to be a forward base for explorers or colonies from already established settlements. The 3 large hardpoints not mounted to tentacles are removed and replaced with 4 more tons of cargo storage and 2 new space docks for ships to dock at between exploratory missions. This variant is usually designed to carry a large number of supplies, as well as making space for a tavern or other recreational activities for sailors.</p>","public":""},"source":"WJMAiS pg. 66"},"traits":{"size":"grg","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dimensions":""},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"vehicleType":"sea","cargo":{"crew":[],"passengers":[]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"kKrrDlkpfIaOdPk6":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Cuttle Command","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":4,"height":4,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"Bulwark Points"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"light":{"dim":0,"bright":0,"angle":360,"alpha":0.25,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"color":null,"coloration":1,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"texture":{"src":"modules/wjmais/assets/cuttle-command-token.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":0,"brightness":1,"color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"visionMode":"basic"},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":1662637376476,"modifiedTime":1662638046173,"lastModifiedBy":"9GlgqX11CNwmlmKz"}}

It boasts an impressive array of 26 medium hardpoints, one built on a turret at the fore and one built on a turret at the aft. The remaining 24 are split half down each side of the main deck for broadside attacks. Regrettably, much like the Galleon, the Clipper wasn't originally designed for use in space. As a result, both ships lack the elegance in design necessary for smooth sailing in space, reflected by low maneuverability.</p><p>That said, you can't put 26 cannons on a ship without the giff being interested There are plenty of wildjammers out there, but the Clipper has a lot more gunpowder than others of its class. Due to this, the giff love to use the Clipper.</p><h3>Example Weapons</h3> <ul><li>26x @Compendium[wjmais.items.12-Pounder Long Gun], 1x front + 12x port + 12x starboard + 1x rear</li></ul><h2>Model Variations</h2> <p>The Clipper has a few variations as a warship, but neither changes the design particularly much. When used as a heavy warship, the giff commodores will often use these ships in pairs as a way to increasing firepower and limiting the ability of an enemy to outmaneuver both of them. Alternatively, the Clipper can be used as a command ship for a giff admiral Usually when this is done, it is accompanied by 3 to 6 additional clippers as supporting heavy warships.</p><p>There is only one configuration that greatly deviates and it is generally created by groundlings, called the Merchantman.

This massive wildjammer was designed to carry significantly more forces than the standard Nautiloid model, including potentially housing an elder brain pool for long voyages. While it isn't particularly maneuverable, the combination of a strong hull, 4 medium hardpoints, and 3 large hardpoints make this heavy frigate a dangerous adversary. Like the Nautiloid, the Dreadnought can only use a Pool Helm designed by and for mind flayers.</p><h3>Example Weapons</h3> <ul><li>3x @Compendium[wjmais.items.24-Pounder Long Gun], 2x front + 1x rear</li><li>4x @Compendium[wjmais.items.Medium Catapult], 2x port + 2x starboard</li></ul><h2>Model Variations</h2> <p>Although the Dreadnought is created and used exclusively by illithids, it does have a few model variations that have been seen around the stars.</p><h3>Heavy Dreadnought</h3> <p>This Dreadnought is built to be even more resilient than its standard counterpart. Its AC is increased to 21 and its hardpoints are replaced by 12 large hardpoints. As a consequence of these changes, the cargo hull is reduced to 8 tons and its speed is reduced to 2,000ft (0°). The fact that this variation is so heavy it can't realistically maneuver in combat has lead to it being of limited use. The perceived value is in using supporting Nautiloids to drive enemy wildjammers into range of the heavily armed Dreadnought.</p><h3>Colony Ship</h3> <p>Every so often, the illithids seek a way to spread themselves to a new world. This often means they need to move an elder brain from one world to another. Since elder brains maintain much of the knowledge of their species, guarding these is of the utmost importance. The Dreadnought's AC is increased to 22 and its cargo hold is reduced to 18 tons. Of these 18 tons, 3 are set aside exclusively for the elder brain.</p><p>To attack a colony ship is viewed by illithids as the greatest of crimes.

Quick, versatile, and powerful, the Man-o- War looks much like a massive plant-like moth or butterfly flying through space. With its powerful wings, it can quickly move itself into a better position for attacks. This has made the Man-o-War one of the more maneuverable ships in space and a terror for the enemies of the Elven Imperial Navy.</p><h3>Example Weapons</h3> <ul><li>5x @Compendium[wjmais.items.12-Pounder Long Gun], 2x front, 2x starboard, 2x port, 2x rear</li></ul><h2>Model Variations</h2> <p>The Man-o-War comes in a handful of varieties, but like the Cutter, the most commonly available ones are not grown in the Elven Imperial Navy shipyards but built out of wood.</p><h3>Starfly Hull</h3> <p>The starfly variant is the original grown by the Elven Imperial Navy. This variant is exceptionally difficult to find if one isn't given one by the Elven Imperial Navy. This variant gains the following feature:</p><p><strong>Starfly Hull.</strong> This ship can be healed by the @Compendium[wjmais.spells.Repair Hull] spell multiple times per day.</p><h3>Thick Wood Hull</h3> <p>This is the wooden variant crafted by shipwrights not associated with the Elven Imperial Navy. This variant is more commonly found, but its speed is reduced to 2,500ft (90°)</p><h3>Fighter Carrier</h3> <p>This variation was originally designed by the Elven Imperial Navy, but other shipwrights have also begun to mimic its design. When grown by elves, this variation is the same as the starfly, but its speed is reduced to 2,500ft (45°) and it loses 3 of its medium hardpoints. In exchange, its cargo hold is increased to 50 tons. When created by other shipwrights, this variation is the same as the thick wood hull, except its speed is reduced to 2,500ft (45°), it loses 3 of its medium hardpoints, and its AC is reduced to 15.</p><p>In exchange for these reductions, the cargo hold on both types is increased to 50 tons. This allows the Man-o-War to carry up to 10 fighter bays for deploying fighter craft, whether they be Spirit Warriors or Blades. The Elven Imperial Navy almost exclusively use this variation for carrying large numbers of elven Bladesingers prepared to use their swordsmanship skills in a Spirit Warrior.</p><h3>Mobile Saloon</h3> <p>This variation is usually created by independent elves or dwarves that are looking to make it into a saloon. This variation usually starts as the thick wood hull, and then has its speed reduced to 2,500ft (45°) and its AC reduced to 15 in exchange for its cargo hold increasing to 42 tons.  This storage space is used for stockpiling anything that travelers might pay a premium for. Most of the time, this is alcohol or drugs. After months of travel, most sailors are more than willing to pay the considerably higher prices of the mobile saloon owners. Mobile saloons also tend to carry food, water, star charts, and just about any standard commodity a wildjammer in space might need, so long as they are willing to pay more than market value for it.</p>","public":""},"source":"WJMAiS pg. 60"},"traits":{"size":"lg","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dimensions":""},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"vehicleType":"sea","cargo":{"crew":[],"passengers":[]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"kKrrDlkpfIaOdPk6":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Man-o-War","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":2,"height":2,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"Bulwark Points"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"light":{"dim":0,"bright":0,"angle":360,"alpha":0.25,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"color":null,"coloration":1,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"texture":{"src":"modules/wjmais/assets/man-o-war-token.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":0,"brightness":1,"color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"visionMode":"basic"},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":1662637376497,"modifiedTime":1662638046184,"lastModifiedBy":"9GlgqX11CNwmlmKz"}}

These enormous undead insects would house an elven warrior inside of their chest cavity and amplify the skill of the warrior. This allowed for elven warriors to bring their considerable skill with a sword into ship vs ship combat.</p><p>Acquiring a spirit warrior wasn't easy. A promising warrior would be granted a small egg, no larger than the size of a pinhead, that had undergone a secret ritual. The warrior would incubate the egg, protecting it and warming it with their own body. After half a year, the egg would hatch into a larva. The warrior would raise the larva and form a strong emotional bond. They would feed it, play with it, think happy thoughts that the larva can feel. This lasts until the larva is a year old, at which point it has matured. Once the larva has matured, it continues to live with the warrior until it dies of old age.</p><p>As soon as it dies, the magic cast upon it as an egg activates. The carcass expands to an enormous size and its chest cavity grows a space for its bonded warrior. When its bonded warrior enters the chest cavity for the first time, the two of them become as one. The warrior's skill becomes the spirit warrior's skill, and the spirit warrior's body becomes the warrior's body.</p><p>True spirit warriors are hard to find and impossible to buy. If a spirit warrior's bonded warrior is dead or abandoned it, another creature can occupy it and try to bond, but that is rare. The easiest way to get a hold of a Spun warrior is to buy an arcanomechanical one off the market. These don't bonding with the warrior in the same way as a true spirit warrior, but they do just fine as a fighter-craft.</p><h3>Helm</h3> <p>The spirit warrior doesn't carry a Wildjammer Helm. Instead, it either flies naturally or mechanically. This generates propulsion through residual magic in wildspace. It can't fly at jamming speeds and the Fighter Helmsman doesn't need to be a spellcaster.</p><h3>Example Weapons</h3> <ul><li><em>Longsword (Mega Scale)</em></li></ul><h2>Model Variations</h2> <p>The spirit warrior comes in a variety of types The stat block presented here is a baseline stat block. Add one of the variations below to this stat block.</p><h3>True Spirit Warrior</h3> <p>This is the original design of the spirit warrior and is undoubtedly the best. Sadly, it is also the one that cannot be purchased, it must be found or grown.

In place of it, the Blade carries a mechanical Helm that generates propulsion through residual magic found in wildspace. This mechanical Helm doesn't require the Fighter Helmsman to be a spellcaster, but it also can't fly at jamming speed.

With a single large hardpoint, reasonable speed and maneuverability and a thick hull, it has become a favorite for pirates and adventurers, It also has a small open area on the top where the large hardpoint is situated that makes for an excellent spot to start a boarding attempt.</p><p>Another interesting feature of the Wasp is that it was designed to be able to be flooded The lizardfolk who designed the wildjammer wanted a way to submerge themselves in water while sailing through space. Having this much water in a wildjammer also allowed the lizardfolk that designed the Wasp to bring their pets along with them.</p><h3>Example Weapons</h3> <ul><li>@Compendium[wjmais.items.24-Pounder Long Gun], 1x front</li></ul><h2>Model Variations</h2> <p>Although the Wasp was originally designed for lizardfolk, its considerable strengths have resulted in it being a more widely adopted wildjammer.</p><h3>Pirate Ship</h3> <p>This variant of the Wasp is designed specifically to be able to land aboard other large wildjammers and board with ease.  This variant loses its ability to land in water but in exchange gains the Quick Boarding feature.</p><p><strong>Quick Boarding.</strong> When the Captain of this wildjammer uses their action for the Boarding Party bridge crew action, other creatures only need a bonus action to join and board the other wildjammer. If the Captain has the Expert Captain feature, the Captain can activate the Boarding Party bridge crew action as a bonus action and each other creature can join without using any action.</p><h3>Bee Class</h3> <p>This variant of the Wasp is designed for those who only intend to sail through space and want a more heavily armed combat wildjammer. This variant loses its ability to land anywhere but a space dock and has its cargo hold reduced to 3 tons, but in exchange it gains 2 additional large hardpoints. These additional hardpoints are almost always equipped with heavy ballistae because of the small crew size of the Wasp.  While 8 crew are required to make it function, that leaves just 10 crew for 3 large hardpoints.</p><h3>Bumble Bee</h3> <p>The bumble bee variant of the Wasp loses its large hardpoint and can only dock at space docks in exchange for 6 additional tons of cargo storage. This variant looks far more bloated than the standard Wasp, marking it as a merchant ship. Often bee class Wasps will find a way to disguse themselves as bumble bee variants to lure in unsuspecting pirates.</p><h3>Quickling</h3> <p>The quickling variant of the Wasp has its hull stripped in favor of quick maneuverability. This variant has its AC reduced to 14 and cargo hold storage reduced to 7 tons, but in exchange has its speed increased to 3,000ft (135?) and gains a medium hardpoint on the wildjammer's tail.</p>","public":""},"source":"WJMAiS pg. 49"},"traits":{"size":"sm","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dimensions":""},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"vehicleType":"sea","cargo":{"crew":[],"passengers":[]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"kKrrDlkpfIaOdPk6":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Wasp","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"Bulwark Points"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"light":{"dim":0,"bright":0,"angle":360,"alpha":0.25,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"color":null,"coloration":1,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"texture":{"src":"modules/wjmais/assets/wasp-token.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":0,"brightness":1,"color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"visionMode":"basic"},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":1662637376510,"modifiedTime":1662638046198,"lastModifiedBy":"9GlgqX11CNwmlmKz"}}

greatest of the Elven Imperial Navy's wildjammer fleet. These wildjammers are surprisingly graceful and quick for their substantial size, as well as carrying a wide array of weapons. Owning an Armada is no small task, as the Elven Imperial Navy guard them fervently.  Unlike with the Cutter and Man-o-War, the Elven Imperial Navy guard the secrets of the Armada so closely that they actively work to silence shipwrights that mimic this design.  Possession of an Armada, whether it is one grown by the Elven Imperial Navy themselves or built by an adventurous shipwright, is treated as a crime against the Elven Imperial Navy and the offenders are immediately put to death.</p><p>Due to this strict attitude, most stay well away from attempting to make Armadas and instead focus on trying to develop other wildjammers to counteract them. Both the Tsunami and the Cuttle Command were originally built as a way to help defend against the power the Armada brings to the Elven Imperial Navy.</p><h3>Example Weapons</h3> <ul><li>14x @Compendium[wjmais.items.24-Pounder Long Gun], 5x front + 3x port + 3x starboard + 3x rear</li><li>3x @Compendium[wjmais.items.12-Pounder Long Gun], 1x front + 1x port + 1x starboard</li></ul><h2>Model Variations</h2> <p>There are a few variations to the Armada</p><h3>Starfly Hull</h3> <p>The starfly variant is the original grown by the Elven Imperial Navy.

This variant is more readily available, but its speed is reduced to 1,500ft (45°).</p><h3>Wild Armada</h3> <p>This variation is the result of a starfly hull Armada being abandoned and left to drift.

Originally designed by various human nations in space, it was created to be one of the cheapest combat oriented wildjammers on the market. Most other cheap combat wildjammers tend to be fitted for combat after the fact, like a fighterfly variant of the Dragonfly. The goal in creating the Threshership was to build an affordable and formidable combat ship for new privateers, who so often found themselves retrofitting commercial ships for combat purposes.</p><p>The Threshership has three hardpoints, two aimed out of its eye slots and one sitting on the top deck just above the head. The head itself acts as a ram, intending to charge up to enemy wildjammers or mega creatures and hit them in close range. This has lead to many using the Threshership as a Fire Projector platform, moving in close, hitting hard, and covering ships in waves of fire.</p><p>What adds to the versatility of the Threshership beyond just a combat wildjammer is that the wildjammer's fins act as landing gear for ground landings. This is beneficial since the cargo storage doors on the side of the wildjammer are partially submerged when in water, making unloading a real chore and the risk of taking on water not negligible.</p><h3>Example Weapons</h3> <ul><li>@Compendium[wjmais.items.Carronade], 1x front</li><li>2x @Compendium[wjmais.items.Medium Ballista]</li></ul><h2>Model Variations</h2> <p>While Thresherships do carry the artistic styling of whatever shipwright worked on creating it, there are no major variations to speak of.

That isn't to say there are no variations, there are countless variations designed for specific adventuring parties or navies, there's just no overly common ones to speak of.</p><p>Some might seek to widen the eye slots to allow for the eye slot hardpoints to be aimed to the sides. Others might want to enhance the small hardpoint located just above the head and ram by reducing cargo storage space.  It is also not uncommon to find Thresherships designed with a cargo storage hatch on the main deck, allowing for a more resilient hull, but this causes issues with the placement of the main sail.</p>","public":""},"source":"WJMAiS pg. 48"},"traits":{"size":"sm","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dimensions":""},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"vehicleType":"sea","cargo":{"crew":[],"passengers":[]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"kKrrDlkpfIaOdPk6":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Threshership","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"Bulwark Points"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"light":{"dim":0,"bright":0,"angle":360,"alpha":0.25,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"color":null,"coloration":1,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"texture":{"src":"modules/wjmais/assets/threshership-token.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":0,"brightness":1,"color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"visionMode":"basic"},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":1662637376516,"modifiedTime":1662638046205,"lastModifiedBy":"9GlgqX11CNwmlmKz"}}
